        Can you identify the end of a coin’s rally using a combination of on-chain, social and trading data?
      </p>

      <p mc:edit="text_1">
        The answer is yes - and it’s easier than you might think.
      </p>


      <p mc:edit="description-1">
      <b>Volume</b> is a powerful concept in finance, often corresponding with major shifts in market conditions.
      </p>


      <p mc:edit="description-21">
        On Sanbase, we calculate not one, but <b>three</b> ‘volumes’ for every coin:
      </p>

      <p mc:edit="description-22221">
        1. Trading volume (based on speculative activity on exchanges)
<br/>
        2. Social volume (amount of coin mentions on crypto social media)
<br/>
        3. On-chain volume (amount of daily addresses interacting with the coin)
      </p>

      <p mc:edit="description-23311">
      Although these are entirely different data points, <i>the same top formation</i> often appears in all three indicators.
      </p>
      <p mc:edit="description-23312">
As long as the price <b>keeps growing on rising volume</b>, the trend is likely to continue. Once we see a <b>clear divergence between the price and volume</b>, the top might be near.
      </p>
      <p mc:edit="description-23313">
Ethereum’s latest drop is a perfect example - all three volumes <i>dipped simultaneously</i> right before the correction, as the price was still pushing upward.

<p mc:edit="description-2442">
Could you use this ‘multi-volume’ concept to identify <b>bottom</b> formations as well? In fact you could! Applied properly, the volume analysis can also measure the <i>strength</i> of a coin’s downward move and assess its <i>bounceback potential</i>.
</p>

<p mc:edit="description-2443">
All three volumes PLUS over a dozen indicators for BTC, ETH, XRP, ERC-20 coins and more are available on Sanbase Pro for just $49/month. But can you really put a price on being ahead of the curve?
