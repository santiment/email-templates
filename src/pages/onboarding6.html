      <p class="body-2"><b>Why It Matters:</b></p>

      <spacer size="8"></spacer>

      <p class="body-2">Understanding network activity is crucial for spotting market tops. By analyzing metrics like
        <b>Daily Active Addresses (DAA)</b> and <b>Network Growth</b>, you can discern when <b>speculative interest may
          be peaking</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        For instance, a spike in these metrics during a price increase, followed by a decline, often signals an
        impending correction.
        <br>
        <br>
        A notable example is ENJ in December, which experienced a correction after on-chain activity subsided
        post-rally(image above.)
        <br>
        <br>
        Use DAA and Network Growth as <b>indicators of a project's long-term health</b>. Consistent growth of new
        addresses and
        continued network activity provide foundational insights into the <b>project's adoption and potential
          longevity</b>.
        For detailed guidance on using these metrics:

      <p class="body-2"><b>Why It Matters:</b></p>

      <spacer size="8"></spacer>

      <p class="body-2">Token Age Consumed (TAC) highlights the <b>movement of long-held tokens</b>, giving observers a
        clue
        about pivotal shifts in market conditions. TAC shows the amount of tokens changing addresses on a certain date,
        multiplied by the time since they last moved.
        <br>
        <br>
        Changes in TAC can signal either upward or downward price movements, as seen in Bitcoin‚Äôs and Bancor‚Äôs TAC
        charts. Such patterns often indicate strategic market entries and exits by longer-term investors.
        <br>
        <br>
        An upward spike in the graph signals large amounts of tokens moving after being idle for an extended period of
        time. Think of these spikes as hints requiring further analysis. For insights on leveraging TAC effectively:
