      <p class="body-1 c-black m-0">
        Thank you for your interest in becoming an early supporter of the SanR network.
        <br>
        Currently, the SanR Network network is in testing mode.
        <br>
        You have the opportunity to participate in the development of the network by running a node in the read-only or
        validator mode.
        <br>
        More detailed information about the testnet and how to install nodes can be found on the node dashboard.
      </p>
