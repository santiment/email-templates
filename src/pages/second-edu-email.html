        Did you know your Sanbase Pro trial comes with <a
          href="http://sheets.santiment.net?utm_campaign=onboarding&utm_medium=email&utm_source=mailchimp&utm_content=CTA"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Sansheets
        </a> - our plugin for importing Santiment data into Google Spreadsheets?
      </p>

      <p mc:edit="description">
        With Sansheets, you can <b>create your own crypto dashboards, test new strategies, or even build an entire
          portfolio manager.</b>
      </p>

      <p mc:edit="text_1">
        Don’t have much experience with Spreadsheets? No worries! With Sanbase Pro, you also gain access to a growing
        number of pre-built templates created by the Santiment team and community.
      </p>


      <p mc:edit="description-who">
        A good example is our <a
          href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xot6ilXMYth5MAw_s_em1wVhhcmaQlh4XQO7AFF3D50/view#gid=1669753201"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Holders</a> template, which <b>tracks the behavior of the
          biggest addresses holding Ethereum</b> and various ERC-20 coins.
      </p>

        For better or worse, <b>crypto is still a whale’s playground</b>. With this dynamic template, you can monitor
        the movement of top coin holders, including changes in their balances, big accumulation/sell-off events and
        week-to-week adjustments to their total holdings.
      </p>
      <p mc:edit="description-23312">
        Whale sell-offs can often indicate a loss of investor confidence, so when you spot major dips in our Top Holder
        template, you <i>might</i> want to consider reducing your exposure in that asset - and vice versa.
      </p>
      <p mc:edit="description-23313">
        This is just <b>one of the many</b> ready-to-go templates you can use with Sanbase Pro. If you’re feeling
        adventurous, you can also create your own strategies and dashboards from scratch, using Sansheets and just a few
        basic Spreadsheets functions. You can even ping our staff to help build a new template. The options are endless!
